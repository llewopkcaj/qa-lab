# AI in Testing — Notes

## How AI Speeds Testing
AI can accelerate the writing of repetitive blocks of code.  
It recognizes the patterns in your syntax and extrapolates from your starting point — though you’ll usually need to provide that starting point and continually moderate it.  
Test frameworks are interdomain systems; an AI like ChatGPT cannot navigate your local file tree (unless integrated with a tool like Copilot).  
Because of that limitation, it’s far more efficient for the user to already have a solid understanding of the testing framework.  

## Common Limitations
This lack of visibility can cause subtle mistakes.  
The AI might assume the wrong fixture name because it cannot read your `conftest.py`, or it might mishandle fixture scope since the project hierarchy isn’t visible unless you explicitly share it.  

I think it’s rare for an AI to generate *invalid syntax* — it’s built on code, and producing syntactically correct structures is almost effortless for it.  
The real problem is semantic: it can misunderstand the user’s intent and produce output that runs but fails to satisfy the true objective.  
In other words, it may produce working code that’s *wrong in meaning*, not form.

## Deeper Conceptual Limits
Beyond lacking intra-domain access, AI also lacks **intra-disciplinary awareness**.  
At higher levels of computer science, progress often depends on synthesizing ideas across domains — something AI isn’t yet capable of.  
In my experience, it’s excellent at summarizing, but less skilled at drawing inferences between disparate sources.  

## Reflection on Human Cognition
On a deeper level, this limitation may reflect something uniquely human.  
We sometimes exhibit what seem like parapsychological intuitions: thinking of someone before they call, or dreaming of an event that later happens.  
These idiosyncrasies suggest a subtle, perhaps quantum, dimension to cognition — a kind of probabilistic awareness that current large language models lack.  
Despite their vast complexity, LLMs cannot yet replicate this spark of intuition and synthesis — the real source of human innovation.

## Connection to QA Automation
In the context of QA, these distinctions matter.  
AI can mirror structure but not *intent*.  
It can scaffold an entire test suite, yet it cannot independently reason about business logic, risk, or user experience.  
The tester’s role — interpreting meaning, anticipating failure, and recognizing unseen interactions — remains irreplaceable.  
AI can extend reach and speed, but the human tester provides direction, discernment, and depth.  
In that sense, true automation is not about removing people from the loop; it’s about amplifying their insight through more responsive tools.
