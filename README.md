# qa-month1

This repository tracks my Python learning and automation projects as part of a 6-month QA Automation roadmap.  
It currently contains completed work from **Week 1 and Week 2**.

## Week 1 â€” Python Foundations (Variables, Lists, Dicts)

- `profile_card.py` â€” variables + f-strings.  
- `favorites.py` â€” list indexing, slicing, and updates.  
- `contact_book.py` â€” nested dictionaries and safe access.  
- `daily_dashboard.py` â€” combined project with variables, lists, dicts.
