# qa-month1

This repository tracks my Python learning and automation projects as part of a 6-month QA Automation roadmap.  
It currently contains completed work from **Week 1 and Week 2**.

---

## Week 1 — Python Foundations (Variables, Lists, Dicts)

- `profile_card.py` — variables + f-strings.  
- `favorites.py` — list indexing, slicing, and updates.  
- `contact_book.py` — nested dictionaries and safe access.  
- `daily_dashboard.py` — combined project with variables, lists, dicts.  
- `poetry_generator.py` — ASCII poetry with random choice.  

---

## Week 2 — Loops, Functions, Exceptions

- `grade_classifier.py` — classify grades with if/elif/else.  
- `truth_table.py` — boolean logic outputs.  
- `loop_katas.py` — loop practice problems.  
- `math_utils.py` — add, mean, describe_person.  
- `scope_demo.py` — local vs global scope.  
- `safe_divide.py` — division with validation & errors.  
- `file_reader.py` — safe file handling.  
- `cli_calculator.py` — interactive calculator with exceptions + docstrings.  

---

## Roadmap

- Week 3: File handling (CSV, JSON).  
- Week 4: OOP basics and ASCII project.  
- Later months: PyTest, Selenium, CI/CD, API/DB testing.

## Goal

By the end of Month 6, this repo will form part of my QA Automation portfolio, showing growth from core Python through professional test frameworks.
